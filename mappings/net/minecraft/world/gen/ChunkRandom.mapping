	FIELD field_13276 sampleCount I
	METHOD <init> (J)V
		ARG 1 seed
	METHOD method_12659 setTerrainSeed (II)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to generate the surface terrain blocks(such as grass, sand, etc)
		COMMENT and the bedrock patterns.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT Note that the terrain seed is NOT world seed dependant and only gets affected by
		COMMENT chunk coordinates.
		ARG 1 chunkX
		ARG 2 chunkZ
	METHOD method_12660 skip (I)V
		COMMENT Skips the provided number of calls to the randomizer.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT Functionally, this method serves no purpose since the combination of multiple linear
		COMMENT congruential calls is equivalent to another LCG.
		ARG 1 callsCount
	METHOD method_12661 setPopulationSeed (JII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to create population features such as decorators and animals.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT This method takes in the world seed and the negative-most block coordinates of the
		COMMENT chunk. The coordinate pair provided is equivalent to (chunkX * 16, chunkZ * 16). The
		COMMENT three values are mixed together through some layers of hashing to produce the
		COMMENT population seed.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT This function has been proved to be reversible through some exploitation of the underlying
		COMMENT nextLong() weaknesses.
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 posX
		ARG 4 posZ

		ARG 0 chunkX

	METHOD method_12663 setCarverSeed (JII)J
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 chunkX
		ARG 4 chunkZ
	METHOD method_12664 setDecoratorSeed (JII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to generate a given feature.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @param populationSeed The population seed computed in setPopulationSeed().
		COMMENT @param index The index of the feature in the feature list.
		COMMENT @param step The generation step's ordinal for this feature.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT The salt, in the form of {index + 10000 * step} assures that each feature is seeded
		COMMENT differently, making the decoration feel more random. Even though it does a good job
		COMMENT at doing so, many entropy issues arise from the salt being so small and result in
		COMMENT weird alignments between features that have an index close apart.
	METHOD method_12665 setRegionSeed (JIII)J
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 regionX
		ARG 4 regionZ
		ARG 5 salt
