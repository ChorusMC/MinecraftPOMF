	COMMENT The distorted 2-D biome interpolator queries the distorted biome
	COMMENT interpolator at y level of 0. Since the distorted biome voxel points
	COMMENT chosen by the parent skewed scaled biome access type may be away from
	COMMENT y = 0, so the result is not equivalent to that of a 2-dimensionally
	COMMENT distorted interpolation.
