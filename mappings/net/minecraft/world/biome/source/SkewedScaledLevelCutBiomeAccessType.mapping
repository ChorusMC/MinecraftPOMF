	COMMENT The skewed scaled level cut biome access type samples the skewed scaled
	COMMENT biome access type at y level of 0. Since the distorted biome voxel points
	COMMENT chosen by the parent skewed scaled biome access type may be away from
	COMMENT y = 0, so the level cut view is not equivalent to a 2-dimensional skewed
	COMMENT scaled view.
