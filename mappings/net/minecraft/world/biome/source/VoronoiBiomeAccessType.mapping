CLASS net/minecraft/class_4546 net/minecraft/world/biome/source/VoronoiBiomeAccessType
	COMMENT The voronoi biome access type distorts the biome volume's voxel points
	COMMENT and finds the closest distorted biome voxel point from a block position
	COMMENT as if in a euclidean voronoi diagram and returns the biome stored in that
	COMMENT biome voxel point.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The resulting biome distribution of the voronoi biome access type is
	COMMENT like a raster of 3d voronoi distribution, hence the name.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT @see HorizontalVoronoiBiomeAccessType
	METHOD method_22397 sqr (D)D
		COMMENT Returns the square of {@code d}.
		ARG 0 d
	METHOD method_22398 calculateShift (J)D
		COMMENT Calculates the shift, in the biome voxel's axis unit, of the weight
		COMMENT center of a biome position from the regular grid position in an axis.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>It takes the 25th to 34th lowest bits of the seed, divides it by
		COMMENT 1024, minuses it by 0.5, and multiply it by 0.9 to get a shift between
		COMMENT -0.45 and 0.45 in the biome voxel's axis unit.
		ARG 0 seed
			COMMENT the seed
	METHOD method_22399 calculateSquaredDistance (JIIIDDD)D
		COMMENT Calculates the squared euclidean distance from an accessed (voxel) point
		COMMENT to the distorted biome (voxel) point based on an original biome point.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>A consistent set of seed and biome x/y/z arguments is always going
		COMMENT to lead to the same distorted point.
		ARG 0 seed
			COMMENT the seed for choosing the distorted biome point
		ARG 2 biomeX
			COMMENT the x position of the original biome point
		ARG 3 biomeY
			COMMENT the y position of the original biome point
		ARG 4 biomeZ
			COMMENT the z position of the original biome point
		ARG 5 distanceX
			COMMENT distance in biome voxel x-axis unit from the accessed
			COMMENT point to the original biome point
		ARG 7 distanceY
			COMMENT distance in biome voxel y-axis unit from the accessed
			COMMENT point to the original biome point
		ARG 9 distanceZ
			COMMENT distance in biome voxel z-axis unit from the accessed
			COMMENT point to the original biome point
