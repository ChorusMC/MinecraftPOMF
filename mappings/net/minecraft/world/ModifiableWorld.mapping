		COMMENT Updates the blockstate at a position within this world calling all appropriate callbacks and event handlers.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>When called on the server, the new blockstate is stored and propagated to clients and listeners as dictated
		COMMENT by the supplied flags. Note that calling this on the client will update the world locally, but may not see the
		COMMENT change persisted across loads. It's recommended to check whether running on the client or server before
		COMMENT interacting with the world in this way.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Accepted values of the flags are a bitset combination of the following:</p>
		COMMENT <ul>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000000 // 0 - DEFAULT/NONE - nothing is notified. The state is merely stored without any visual changes</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000001 // 1 - PROPAGATE_CHANGE - Propagates a change event to surrounding blocks.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000010 // 2 - NOTIFY_LISTENERS - Notifies listeners and clients who need to react when the block changes</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000100 // 4 - NO_REDRAW - Used in conjunction with NOTIFY_LISTENERS to suppress the render pass on clients.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0001000 // 8 - REDRAW_ON_MAIN_THREAD - Forces a synchronous redraw on clients.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0010000 // 16 - FORCE_STATE - Bypass virtual blockstate changes and forces the passed state to be stored as-is.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0100000 // 32 - SKIP_DROPS - Prevents the previous block (container) from dropping items when destroyed.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b1000000 // 64 - IS_MECHANICAL_UPDATE - Signals that this is a mechanical update, usually caused by pistons moving blocks.</li>
		COMMENT </ul>
		COMMENT
		ARG 1 pos
			COMMENT The position of the blockstate to be replaced.
		ARG 2 state
			COMMENT The state of the blockstate to set at this position.
		ARG 3 flags
			COMMENT Update/listener flags for how the change must be propagated to the client and surrounding blocks.
