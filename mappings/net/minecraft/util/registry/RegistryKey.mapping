CLASS net/minecraft/class_5321 net/minecraft/util/registry/RegistryKey
	COMMENT A sugarcoated {@link Identifier} with a specific type of usage.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Compared to a regular identifier, this class has an extra generic
	COMMENT type {@code T} and {@link #registry another validation-purposed
	COMMENT identifier} indicating the usage. Compared to using identifiers directly,
	COMMENT this registry key can prevent accidental misusage of identifier, such as
	COMMENT using an identifier intended for items to look up an entity type. The
	COMMENT extra identifier guarantees the usage type at runtime while the generic
	COMMENT guarantees the usage type at compile time.</p>
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This class is immutable and compares by identity. Hence, all created
	COMMENT instances are stored in {@link #INSTANCES a synchronized map}. Per
	COMMENT Mojang employee fry (RainWarrior), comparison by identity offers a
	COMMENT performance boost.</p>

	COMMENT @see Registry#ROOT
	FIELD field_25136 INSTANCES Ljava/util/Map;
		COMMENT A cache of all registry keys ever created.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>The keys are stored as joining the string form of two identifiers
		COMMENT with a {@code :}, and the map is a synchronized identity hash map where
		COMMENT the string keys used to look up keys are interned. <b>These details
		COMMENT should not be relied on as they are implementation details that can be
		COMMENT changed without affecting any user.</b></p>
	FIELD field_25137 registry Lnet/minecraft/class_2960;
		COMMENT The validated usage type of this registry key.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>In most cases, this is the identifier of the registry in the root
		COMMENT registry. For example, this value for a registry key for a
		COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.block.Block} is {@code minecraft:block}.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This usage type is only used internally for validation and is not
		COMMENT meant to be exposed.</p>
	FIELD field_25138 value Lnet/minecraft/class_2960;
		COMMENT The actual identifier in the sugarcoat.

	METHOD method_29178 createKeyFactory (Lnet/minecraft/class_5321;)Ljava/util/function/Function;
		COMMENT Creates a function that sugarcoats identifiers to registry keys.
		COMMENT Requires another registry key of a registry to indicate the usage of
		COMMENT the created registry keys.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>For example, this can create a function that sugarcoat an identifer
		COMMENT to a registry key for {@link net.minecraft.block.Block} when
		COMMENT {@link Registry#BLOCK_KEY the registry key of the block registry} is
		COMMENT passed.</p>

		COMMENT Sugarcoats an identifier to a specific usage, given the registry key of
		COMMENT the registry of that usage.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>For example, you can sugarcoat an identifer for items with
		COMMENT {@link Registry#ITEM_KEY the registry key of the item registry}.
		COMMENT You can call it like {@code RegistryKey.of(Registry.ITEM_KEY, new Identifier("iron_ingot"))}
		COMMENT to sugarcoat the id for iron ingot.</p>

		COMMENT @return the sugarcoated identifier
		ARG 0 registry
			COMMENT the registry key of the registry of that usage, usually
			COMMENT available in {@link Registry}
		ARG 1 value
			COMMENT the identifier to sugarcoat
	METHOD method_29180 ofRegistry (Lnet/minecraft/class_2960;)Lnet/minecraft/class_5321;
		COMMENT Sugarcoats an identifier for accessing a specific type of registry in
		COMMENT the root registry.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>You can call it like {@code RegistryKey.ofRegistry(new Identifier("block"))}
		COMMENT to obtain a registry key of {@code RegistryKey<Registry<Block>>} type
		COMMENT for the block registry.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p><strong>Notice</strong>: This method can refit the generic {@code <T>}
		COMMENT as any type, so it's on the user's discretion to assign a correct
		COMMENT type!</p>

		COMMENT Sugarcoats an identifier with a specific usage.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This method handles the identity-based handling of registry keys.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Though this method is private, calling
