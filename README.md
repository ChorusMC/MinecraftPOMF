Download Enigma from [here](http://modmuss50.me:8080/job/Enigma-Asie/) ([source](https://github.com/OpenModLoader/Enigma)). Use the "-all" JAR.

Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP) is **completely forbidden**. It is also good to consult name changes with other people via pull requests.

WIP mapping guidelines are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15fHL-WgK0uMPAy-WJbQtxrfOVLJNlfasjsnt_wruOXA/edit). Feel free to contribute.
